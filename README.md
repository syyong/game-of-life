# game-of-life
![My version of game of life](https://github.com/syyong/game-of-life/blob/master/sy-game-of-life.gif)

This is the first project that I worked on from https://robertheaton.com

Here are the instructions, if you want to try it out:

Unfortunately, I heard about the passing of [John Horton Conway (the inventor of game of life)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) a few days after I started working on this. RIP.
